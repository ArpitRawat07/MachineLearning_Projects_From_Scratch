Handwritten Digit Recognition using Artificial Neural Networks using Just NUMPY.
I have achieved 95+ accuracy on the training dataset and 90+ accuracy on the testing dataset; which can be further increased by adjusting the epochs, learning rate and the number of layers accordingly.
DigitRecognizer Notebook with the pkl file has been uploaded.
I have also uploaded the dataset and some of the sample images.
Any model can be trained or customized on any dataset, using the provided code but ensure tuning the hyperparametrs and making some changes in the neural network(NN) class.(Just the shape and size of the input/output)
